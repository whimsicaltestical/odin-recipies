        <h1>Pork Fried Rice</h1>
        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-assets.meredithcorp.io%2F7b6282eda859f81a0cb8d5aa5b8f96dd%2F1649541400image.jpg&w=595&h=398&c=sc&poi=face&q=60">
          <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This is a revised version of another pork fried rice recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.</p>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped carrot</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped broccoli</li>
                <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 cup cold cooked rice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup frozen peas</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, carrot, broccoli, peas, and green onion in melted butter until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat.</li>
                <li>Scramble egg in the skillet until completely set. Return the pork mixture to the skillet. Stir rice, peas, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger into the pork mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
